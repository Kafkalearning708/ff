The real meaning of a “SFTP-backed S3 bucket” is that AWS Transfer Family provides a fully managed SFTP server, and it stores all uploaded files directly into an S3 bucket behind the scenes — that’s why it’s called “SFTP-backed S3.”
Initially, we were confused and thought it was either just an S3 bucket or a regular SFTP server.
The SHA-256 key shared by the Platform Engineering team is actually the server host key fingerprint, which helps verify the identity of the SFTP server during connection.
It’s not related to IAM or user authentication — that part is handled through SSH key-based access configured within the Transfer Family service.

The SHA-256 key shared by the Platform Engineering team is the server host key fingerprint, used to verify the server’s identity when connecting via SFTP.
This is part of the SFTP trust process, and user authentication happens through SSH public keys, not via IAM
